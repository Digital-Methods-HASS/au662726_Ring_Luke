  abstract = {The merit of a given piece of music is difficult to evaluate objectively; the merit of a computational system that creates such a piece of music may be even more so. In this article, we propose that there may be limitations resulting from assumptions made in the evaluation of autonomous compositional or creative systems. The article offers a review of computational creativity, evolutionary compositional methods and current methods of evaluating creativity. We propose that there are potential limitations in the discussion and evaluation of generative systems from two standpoints. First, many systems only consider evaluating the final artefact produced by the system whereas computational creativity is defined as a behaviour exhibited by a system. Second, artefacts tend to be evaluated according to recognised human standards. We propose that while this may be a natural assumption, this focus on human-like or human-based preferences could be limiting the potential and generality of future music generating or creative-AI systems.},

  abstract = {Voice cloning is a highly desired feature for personalized speech interfaces. We introduce a neural voice cloning system that learns to synthesize a person's voice from only a few audio samples. We study two approaches: speaker adaptation and speaker encoding. Speaker adaptation is based on fine-tuning a multi-speaker generative model. Speaker encoding is based on training a separate model to directly infer a new speaker embedding, which will be applied to a multi-speaker generative model. In terms of naturalness of the speech and similarity to the original speaker, both approaches can achieve good performance, even with a few cloning audios.  While speaker adaptation can achieve slightly better naturalness and similarity, cloning time and required memory for the speaker encoding approach are significantly less, making it more favorable for low-resource deployment.},

Previous research suggests that emotions in music may relate to the listener’s anticipation of how the music progresses. The focus of this study was to investigate perceived emotions in musical harmony. A repeated measures experiment was conducted to measure how different variations of simple, computer generated two-chord progressions affect ratings of valence and arousal, and whether coherent structures would emerge from these ratings. The musical background of participants was assessed and used to identify potential differences in ratings between musicians and nonmusicians. The study found a significant negative correlation between ratings of valence and the number of non-diatonic notes per progression. The study also found that musicians were more consistent at rating chord progressions in terms of arousal and valence, as measured by ICC scores.},

  abstract = {As an historian whose interests lie in both contemporary disaster practice as well the historical roots of vulnerability, I have become increasingly intrigued by the manner in which the proponents of these two ‘fields’ approach the question of time in relation to disasters. Needless to say these actors regard it very differently. Social scientists (and here I include mainly sociologists, anthropologists and human geographers) largely pay lip service to its importance, at best mentioning its relevance en passant but giving historical analysis and specific historical example little real consideration in the greater scheme of things. At the same time, though, they place inordinate emphasis on the importance of ‘process’ as the basis upon which their understanding of what turns a natural hazard into a disaster depends. The concept of vulnerability is proposed as the key to understanding how social systems generate unequal exposure to risk by making some people more prone to disaster than others, a condition that is largely a function of the power relations operative in each society (Cannon 1994:14–15, 19; Wisner 1993:131–133). Vulnerability to historians, on the other hand, is not even really a conceptual term and, when used at all, usually indicates a state of being not a condition derivative of historical processes. Above all, disasters are primarily ‘events’ caused by a combination of seismological, meteorological or epidemiological agents (occasionally war is seen in this context as well)               2               that have certain detrimental physical and socioeconomic consequences. At their most extreme, they may even cause the downfall of societies. However, they are rarely integrated into any wider theoretical perspective (Ambraseys 1971; Landsberg 1980). Though both social scientists and historians may talk about disasters, they are not necessarily talking about the same thing: the one sees disasters as primarily a historical processes (or processes set within recent temporal parameters), the other as non-sequential historical events. This is unfortunate because primarily disasters are both historical processes and sequential events. If this assertion sounds rather convoluted, I trust the following discussion will make the distinction somewhat clearer though no amount of clarification is really sufficient to adequately address this question. Instead, I intend what I say more as ‘a line of thinking in progress’ than ‘a work in progress’.},

Nevertheless, it tends to emphasize an anthropocentric view of social life and cognition. This often leads to confusion between ultimate and proximate mechanisms, and an over-reliance on a Cartesian, narratively structured view of the mind and social life, which in turn lead to views of social complexity that are congenial to our views of ourselves, rather than necessarily representative of primate social worlds. In this paper, we argue for greater attention to embodied and distributed theories of cognition, which get us away from current fixations on ‘theory of mind’ and other high-level anthropocentric constructions, and allow for the generation of testable hypotheses that combine neurobiology, psychology and behaviour in a mutually reinforcing manner.},

  abstract = {Response inhibition relies on both proactive and reactive mechanisms that exert a synergic control on goal-directed actions. It is typically evaluated by the go/no-go (GNG) and the stop signal task (SST) with response recording based on the key-press method. However, the analysis of discrete variables (i.e., present or absent responses) registered by key-press could be insufficient to capture dynamic aspects of inhibitory control. Trying to overcome this limitation, in the present study we used a mouse tracking procedure to characterize movement profiles related to proactive and reactive inhibition. A total of fifty-three participants performed a cued GNG and an SST. The cued GNG mainly involves proactive control whereas the reactive component is mainly engaged in the SST. We evaluated the velocity profile from mouse trajectories both for responses obtained in the Go conditions and for inhibitory failures. Movements were classified as one-shot when no corrections were observed. Multi-peaked velocity profiles were classified as non-one-shot. A higher proportion of one-shot movements was found in the SST compared to the cued GNG when subjects failed to inhibit responses. This result suggests that proactive control may be responsible for unsmooth profiles in inhibition failures, supporting a differentiation between these tasks.},

  abstract = {Concepts of motivation are vital to progress in behavioral neuroscience. Motivational concepts help us to understand what limbic brain systems are chiefly evolved to do, i.e., to mediate psychological processes that guide real behavior. This article evaluates some major motivation concepts that have historic importance or have influenced the interpretation of behavioral neuroscience research. These concepts include homeostasis, setpoints and settling points, intervening variables, hydraulic drives, drive reduction, appetitive and consummatory behavior, opponent processes, hedonic reactions, incentive motivation, drive centers, dedicated drive neurons (and drive neuropeptides and receptors), neural hierarchies, and new concepts from affective neuroscience such as allostasis, cognitive incentives, and reward ‘liking’ versus ‘wanting’.},

  abstract = {The diffusion of information is defined as the communication process by which an idea or information spreads within a social system and impacts the behavior of social actors (individuals). The social interaction plays an important role in studying the propagation of information and how it influences people. When an informational event occurs, it can either die out quickly or have significant impact on a population. The interactions could be supported by physical proximity contact, remote collaboration, any type of social meetings, and some forms of verbal or written communication, depending on the situations. Institutions and firms search to understand and predict the impact of information propagation on individuals. Agent-based modeling is a powerful approach for studying such a collective process. However, existing models oversimplify the cultural attributes, the different types of links, and information content, despite the evidence of their central role in the diffusion process.In this context, great benefits could be derived from the exploitation of an individual?s personality and cultural values in the diffusion models. In this paper, we describe a new architecture for an agent-based model using the DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) framework and show how this architecture is flexible and can support the simulation of the dissemination process. In more detail, we define a set of models of individuals characterized by a set of state variables to represent the behavior of an individual and the individual?s network within a multi-layer social network. Then, we start by introducing the platform architecture, specifically designed to simulate message propagation in a multi-layer network. Finally, a military scenario of message diffusion during a stabilization phase is used to test our DEVS models on the platform and the relevancy of the simulation results.},

Until now, experimental studies of co-ordination have concentrated on the development of shared strategies for reference. We present an experiment that employed a novel confederate-scripting technique to investigate whether speakers also co-ordinate syntactic structure in dialogue. Pairs of speakers took it in turns to describe pictures to each other. One speaker was a confederate of the experimenter and produced scripted descriptions that systematically varied in syntactic structure. The syntactic structure of the confederate's description affected the syntactic structure of the other speaker's subsequent description. We suggest that these effects are instances of syntactic priming (Bock, 1986), and provide evidence for a shared level of representation in comprehension and production. We describe how these effects might be realized in a processing model of language production, and relate them to previous findings of linguistic co-ordination in dialogue.},

We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.},

  abstract = {Workers’ unsafe behaviors have a substantial impact on construction safety. To regulate workers’ unsafe behavior, construction practitioners have mainly used formal controls (e.g., penalties). However, the formal approaches may not be effective at eliciting desired behavioral changes in improving safety behavior. Therefore, recently, researchers have paid more attention to how unsafe behaviors are produced. In this regard, cognitive models of safety behavior and empirical evidence on social influence have been suggested. However, there is a noticeable paucity of research investigating the mechanism behind the link between cognitive process, social influence, site risk, and safety behavior. In this paper, an empirically based agent-based model that incorporates theoretical and empirical findings of the sociocognitive process of workers’ safety behaviors is developed. The model is used to conduct experiments examining how the sociocognitive process interacts with safety management interventions (i.e., strictness and frequency of management feedback, and project identification) and influences workers’ safety behaviors across different site risk conditions (i.e., low-, modest-, and high-risk conditions). The results demonstrated that all three interventions contribute to decreasing the incident rate. Also, the interaction effects of the interventions in different site risk conditions were found using the parameter sweeping. The results indicated that (1) promoting workers’ project identification would be an effective strategy in the modest-risk site condition; (2) other interventions should be combined after achieving the medium strictness of management feedback in the high-risk site condition; and (3) other interventions would not be effective without very strict management feedback in the low-risk site condition. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on construction safety by extending the authors’ understanding of the role of sociocognitive process and its interaction with the environment in shaping workers’ safety behaviors. Additionally, the experiment results are expected to lay a strong foundation for developing effective safety management interventions in the construction projects.

  abstract = {Following their success in Computer Vision and other areas, deep learning techniques have recently become widely adopted in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research. However, the majority of works aim to adopt and assess methods that have been shown to be effective in other domains, while there is still a great need for more original research focusing on music primarily and utilising musical knowledge and insight. The goal of this paper is to boost the interest of beginners by providing a comprehensive tutorial and reducing the barriers to entry into deep learning for MIR. We lay out the basic principles and review prominent works in this hard to navigate the field. We then outline the network structures that have been successful in MIR problems and facilitate the selection of building blocks for the problems at hand. Finally, guidelines for new tasks and some advanced topics in deep learning are discussed to stimulate new research in this fascinating field.},

  abstract = {Drawing on advances in social science, evolutionary biology, genetics, neuroscience, and network science, Blueprint shows how and why evolution has placed us on a humane path -- and how we are united by our common humanity. For too long, scientists have focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for aggression, cruelty, prejudice, and self-interest. But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all our inventions -- our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations -- we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society. In Blueprint, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide. With many vivid examples -- including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own -- Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness. In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it's tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, Blueprint shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies have shaped, and are still shaping, our genes today.},

In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.},

  abstract = {A distinguishing feature of video games is their interactivity, and sound plays an important role in this: a player's actions can trigger dialogue, sound effects, ambient sound, and music. And yet game sound has been neglected in the growing literature on game studies. This book fills that gap, introducing readers to the many complex aspects of game audio, from its development in early games to theoretical discussions of immersion and realism. In Game Sound, Karen Collins draws on a range of sources--including composers, sound designers, voice-over actors and other industry professionals, Internet articles, fan sites, industry conferences, magazines, patent documents, and, of course, the games themselves--to offer a broad overview of the history, theory, and production practice of video game audio. Game Sound has two underlying themes: how and why games are different from or similar to film or other linear audiovisual media; and technology and the constraints it has placed on the production of game audio. Collins focuses first on the historical development of game audio, from penny arcades through the rise of home games and the recent rapid developments in the industry. She then examines the production process for a contemporary game at a large game company, discussing the roles of composers, sound designers, voice talent, and audio programmers; considers the growing presence of licensed intellectual property (particularly popular music and films) in games; and explores the function of audio in games in theoretical terms. Finally, she discusses the difficulties posed by nonlinearity and interactivity for the composer of game music [Publisher description].},

Visbrain consists of two levels of abstraction: (1) objects which represent highly configurable neuro-oriented visual primitives (3D brain, sources connectivity, etc.) and (2) graphical user interfaces for higher level interactions. The object level offers flexible and modular tools to produce and automate the production of figures using an approach similar to that of Matplotlib with subplots. The second level visually connects these objects by controlling properties and interactions through graphical interfaces. The current release of Visbrain (version 0.4.2) contains 14 different objects and three responsive graphical user interfaces, built with PyQt: Signal, for the inspection of time-series and spectral properties, Brain for any type of visualization involving a 3D brain and Sleep for polysomnographic data visualization and sleep analysis. Each module has been developed in tight collaboration with end-users, i.e., primarily neuroscientists and domain experts, who bring their experience to make Visbrain as transparent as possible to the recording modalities (e.g., intracranial EEG, scalp-EEG, MEG, anatomical and functional MRI). Visbrain is developed on top of VisPy, a Python package providing high-performance 2D and 3D visualization by leveraging the computational power of the graphics card. Visbrain is available on Github and comes with a documentation, examples, and datasets (http://visbrain.org).},

While providing useful snapshots of journalistic practice, studies using the hierarchical model have rarely accounted for changes in newsgathering over time. This study examines the emergence of climate journalism in the Philippines, one of the most vulnerable nations to the effects of climate change. Drawing on interviews with Filipino journalists, it finds that journalists struggled to place climate-related stories until after extreme weather events, particularly Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. News articles about climate change continued to grow in the following years, suggesting that a fundamental shift in the newsworthiness of climate change took place.},

  abstract = {Like “rationalism” and “empiricism,”“existentialism” is a term that belongs to intellectualhistory. Its definition is thus to some extent one of historicalconvenience. The term was explicitly adopted as a self-description byJean-Paul Sartre, and through the wide dissemination of the postwarliterary and philosophical output of Sartre and hisassociates—notably Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,and Albert Camus—existentialism became identified with acultural movement that flourished in Europe in the 1940s and1950s. Among the major philosophers identified as existentialists(many of whom—for instance Camus and Heidegger—repudiatedthe label) were Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, and Martin Buber inGermany, Jean Wahl and Gabriel Marcel in France, the SpaniardsJosé Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno, and the RussiansNikolai Berdyaev and Lev Shestov. The nineteenth century philosophers,Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, came to be seen asprecursors of the movement. Existentialism was as much a literaryphenomenon as a philosophical one. Sartre's own ideas were and arebetter known through his fictional works (such as Nauseaand No Exit) than through his more purely philosophical ones(such as Being and Nothingness and Critique ofDialectical Reason), and the postwar years found a very diversecoterie of writers and artists linked under the term: retrospectively,Dostoevsky, Ibsen, and Kafka were conscripted; in Paris there wereJean Genet, André Gide, André Malraux, and theexpatriate Samuel Beckett; the Norwegian Knut Hamsun and the RomanianEugene Ionesco belong to the club; artists such as Alberto Giacomettiand even Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, ArshileGorky, and Willem de Kooning, and filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godardand Ingmar Bergman were understood in existential terms. By the mid1970s the cultural image of existentialism had become a cliché,parodized in countless books and films by Woody Allen., It is sometimes suggested, therefore, that existentialism just is thisbygone cultural movement rather than an identifiable philosophicalposition; or, alternatively, that the term should be restricted toSartre's philosophy alone. But while a philosophical definition ofexistentialism may not entirely ignore the cultural fate of the term,and while Sartre's thought must loom large in any account ofexistentialism, the concept does pick out a distinctive cluster ofphilosophical problems and helpfully identifies a relatively distinctcurrent of twentieth- and now twenty-first-century philosophicalinquiry, one that has had significant impact on fields such astheology (through Rudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich, Karl Barth, andothers) and psychology (from Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss to OttoRank, R. D.  Laing, and Viktor Frankl). What makes this current ofinquiry distinct is not its concern with “existence” ingeneral, but rather its claim that thinking about humanexistence requires new categories not found in the conceptualrepertoire of ancient or modern thought; human beings can beunderstood neither as substances with fixed properties, nor assubjects interacting with a world of objects., On the existential view, to understand what a human being is it is notenough to know all the truths that natural science—including thescience of psychology—could tell us. The dualist who holds thathuman beings are composed of independentsubstances—“mind” and “body”—is nobetter off in this regard than is the physicalist, who holds thathuman existence can be adequately explained in terms of thefundamental physical constituents of the universe. Existentialism doesnot deny the validity of the basic categories of physics, biology,psychology, and the other sciences (categories such as matter,causality, force, function, organism, development, motivation, and soon). It claims only that human beings cannot be fully understood interms of them. Nor can such an understanding be gained bysupplementing our scientific picture with a moralone. Categories of moral theory such as intention, blame,responsibility, character, duty, virtue, and the like docapture important aspects of the human condition, but neither moralthinking (governed by the norms of the good and the right) norscientific thinking (governed by the norm of truth)suffices. , “Existentialism”, therefore, may be defined as thephilosophical theory which holds that a further set of categories,governed by the norm of authenticity, is necessary to grasphuman existence. To approach existentialism in this categorial way mayseem to conceal what is often taken to be its “heart”(Kaufmann 1968: 12), namely, its character as a gesture of protestagainst academic philosophy, its anti-system sensibility, its flightfrom the “iron cage” of reason. But while it is true thatthe major existential philosophers wrote with a passion and urgencyrather uncommon in our own time, and while the idea that philosophycannot be practiced in the disinterested manner of an objectivescience is indeed central to existentialism, it is equally true thatall the themes popularly associated with existentialism—dread,boredom, alienation, the absurd, freedom, commitment, nothingness, andso on—find their philosophical significance in the context ofthe search for a new categorial framework, together with its governingnorm.},

Different from other studies, this article examines how space and distance affect the diffusion of memes. Simulations were carried out to emulate and to allow assessment of the different levels of efficiency that memes spread spatially and temporally. Analyzed network structures include random networks and preferential attachment networks. Simulated spatial processes for meme diffusion include independent cascade models and linear threshold models. Both simulated and real-world social networks were used in the analysis. Findings indicate that the numbers of information sources and opinion leaders affect the processes of meme diffusion. In addition, geography is still important in the processes of spatial diffusion of memes over social media networks.},

Incentivized by improving rewards, 3- to 4-year-old children progressed from the first to the third level by imitating observed actions, taught other members of their social group how to solve the problem, and shared the rewards obtained. By contrast, neither the capuchins nor chimpanzees, very few of which ever reached the third level, exhibited these charactertistics.                        ,              Humans not only watch and imitate each other but also learn from each other in multiple ways.           ,              The remarkable ecological and demographic success of humanity is largely attributed to our capacity for cumulative culture, with knowledge and technology accumulating over time, yet the social and cognitive capabilities that have enabled cumulative culture remain unclear. In a comparative study of sequential problem solving, we provided groups of capuchin monkeys, chimpanzees, and children with an experimental puzzlebox that could be solved in three stages to retrieve rewards of increasing desirability. The success of the children, but not of the chimpanzees or capuchins, in reaching higher-level solutions was strongly associated with a package of sociocognitive processes—including teaching through verbal instruction, imitation, and prosociality—that were observed only in the children and covaried with performance.},

  abstract = {The airplane turnaround time costs money to the airline companies and, over the years, it has been determined that the best way to reduce it is by using efficient boarding strategies. Many boarding strategies have been proposed but a consensus as to which is the best method has not been reached yet. The aim of this paper is to gather and test all these strategies considering the same initial conditions in order to help airline companies identify the best boarding strategy. Minimizing the costs not only contributes to airlines’ sustainability and long-term performance, but also influences their ticketing policy, and has an impact on their customers’ choices. Moreover, airports can benefit from the fact that the airline companies are optimizing their boarding strategies as they can extend the number of services offered to more airlines during one day without investing in new infrastructure. Thus, this paper considers 24 boarding strategies and builds a configurable agent-based model using NetLogo 6.0.2 to perform different simulations. The results are analysed using grey systems theory considering the aircraft dimensions, aircraft occupancy and whether or not passengers are carrying hand luggage that may need storage.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable childhood behavioral disorder affecting 5\% of children and 2.5\% of adults. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ADHD susceptibility, but no variants have been robustly associated with ADHD. We report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 20,183 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 35,191 controls that identifies variants surpassing genome-wide significance in 12 independent loci, finding important new information about the underlying biology of ADHD. Associations are enriched in evolutionarily constrained genomic regions and loss-of-function intolerant genes and around brain-expressed regulatory marks. Analyses of three replication studies: a cohort of individuals diagnosed with ADHD, a self-reported ADHD sample and a meta-analysis of quantitative measures of ADHD symptoms in the population, support these findings while highlighting study-specific differences on genetic overlap with educational attainment. Strong concordance with GWAS of quantitative population measures of ADHD symptoms supports that clinical diagnosis of ADHD is an extreme expression of continuous heritable traits.}

These pretensions provide two yardsticks which together take care of the charge of scientific prejudice that any suggested demarcation of pseudo-science has to face. To demonstrate that my analysis has teeth I will apply it to Freud and modern-day Bach-kabbalists. Against Laudan I will argue that the problem of demarcation is not a pseudo-problem, though the discussion will bear out that Laudan's replacement question, namely the question whether someone's theory is well-confirmed, is not, as Lugg claimed, independent of the question as to whether that person is a pseudoscientist. I further argue that my prototype pseudo-scientists do not have the shortcomings highlighted in Thagard's recent analysis of pseudo-science.},

In this groundbreaking book Zoltán Dienes introduces students to key issues in the philosophy of science and statistics that have a direct and vital bearing on the practice of research in psychology. The book is organised around the influential thinkers and conceptual debates which pervade psychological research and teaching but until now have not been made accessible to students. In a clear and fluid style, Dienes takes the reader on a compelling tour of the ideas of: Popper ; Kuhn \& Lakatos ; Neyman \& Pearson ; Bayes ; Fisher \& Royall. Featuring examples drawn from extensive teaching experience to ground the ideas firmly in psychological science, the book is an ideal companion to courses and modules in psychological research methods and also to those covering conceptual and historical issues"--Provided by publisher.},

The individual tasks are allocated to autonomous entities, known as agents. Each agent decides on a proper action to solve the task using multiple inputs, e.g., history of actions, interactions with its neighboring agents, and its goal. The MAS has found multiple applications, including modeling complex systems, smart grids, and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by MAS, including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of MAS, starting from definitions, features, applications, challenges, and communications to evaluation. A classification on MAS applications and challenges is provided along with references for further studies. We expect this paper to serve as an insightful and comprehensive resource on the MAS for researchers and practitioners in the area.},

This has led to a certain degree of confusion and inconsistency between competing notions of emotions, data, and results. The present review of 251 studies describes the focus of prevalent research approaches, methods, and models of emotion, and documents the types of musical stimuli used over the past twenty years. Although self-report approaches to emotions are the most common way of dealing with music and emotions, using multiple approaches is becoming increasingly popular. A large majority (70\%) of the studies employed variants of the discrete or the dimensional emotion models. A large proportion of stimuli rely on a relatively modest amount of familiar classical examples.

However, in the context of climate change and an increase in associated hazards and disasters, we suggest the need to re-examine this dynamic relationship—a complex association we define here as the Affluence–Vulnerability Interface (AVI). We review research in different national contexts to show how a more nuanced understanding of the AVI can (a) problematize the notion that increasing material affluence necessarily has a mitigating influence on social vulnerability, (b) extend our analysis of social vulnerability beyond low-income regions to include affluent contexts and (c) improve our understanding of how psychosocial characteristics influence people’s vulnerability. Finally, we briefly outline three methodological approaches that we believe will assist future engagement with the AVI.},

In this work, we propose PyNetSYM, an agent-based modeling framework designed to be friendly to programmers and non-programmers alike. PyNetSYM provides a domain-specific language to specify social network simulations expressed as agent-based models. PyNetSYM was created to deal with large simulations and to work effortlessly with other social network analysis toolkits.}

  abstract = {This thesis describes an exploratory application of a statistical analysis and modeling technique (Markov chains) for the modeling of jazz improvisation with the intended subobjective of providing increased insight into an improviser's style and creativity through the postulation of quantitative measures of style and creativity based on the constructed Markovian analysis techniques. Using Visual Basic programming language, Markov chains of orders one to three are created using transcriptions of improvised solos by John Coltrane in his song Giant Steps.  Still considered as statistical data, the Markov chains are examined and information is extracted from them through the development of several statistical tools for musical analysis.  Two general categories of tools for analysis are developed: Subtraction matrices and graphical comparisons of distributions.  Using these tools and the raw Markov chain data for musical analysis, quantitative measures for creativity and style are postulated.  These measures are based on previously developed models and definitions of creativity and style taken from the literature.  The information acquired from the implementation of the analysis tools is applied to the models in order to provide a theoretical basis for the development of the quantitative measures and a framework for the interpretation of the information.  Guilford's Structure of Intellect model is used for developing creativity measures and Heen's model of the constructs of style analysis is used for determining measures of style. Overall, this research found that Markov chains provide distinct and useful information for musical analysis in the domain of jazz improvisation.  Many examples of Markov chains are enumerated and tools for analysis are developed that implement the Markov chains.  It is then explained how Markov chains and the tools for their analysis can be interpreted to determine quantitative measures of creativity and style.  Finally, this thesis presents conclusions on Markov chain portrayals, new analysis tools and procedures, quantitative measures of creativity and style, and, in sum, that Markovian modeling is in fact a reasonable and useful modeling approach for this application.},

  abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts.                            It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain’s attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on               empirical Bayes               and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective.                          In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

  abstract = {Since the 1990s medical technology has afforded exciting possibilities for studying the brain. Together with knowledge accrued through psychology and psychiatry, it has set the stage for pioneering research and stimulated disciplines such as Social Neuroscience, the Cognitive Science of Religion, Cognitive Anthropology, and Cognitive Archaeology. Another discipline has arisen, Neurotheology, which is interested in the brain and religious experience. Early proponents such as d’Aquili and Newberg had a religious agenda in their work. Others, such as members of Transcendental Meditation, have used experimental and brain studies to legitimate religious agendas. Experiential shamanists have embarked on a similar legitimation process. The differences between science and therapy and spirituality have been blurred or denied. Neurotheological attempts to discover areas of the brain responsible for religious experiences have led to untenable results. The fact that such research has passed the peer review process of leading psychological, psychiatric, and neurological journals is perhaps more indicative of the pervasiveness of religiosity throughout American society than of objective brain science. This essay argues that neurotheology is an example of the struggle between confessional and critical approaches to the study of religion. The main difference is that the battlefield of this struggle is the brain.},

But mindfulness is a word, and like other words, mindfulness is used in a variety of ways. That is, different people, whether ancient Buddhists or contemporary neuroscientists, may use and define mindfulness—or Pali sati, Sanskrit smrti, Chinese nian, and Tibetan dran pa—in different ways and it is not clear what standard we might use to judge any given account of mindfulness as either wanting or fitting. In this discussion I attempt to take in the earliest Buddhist conceptions of mindfulness (fourth to second centuries B.C.E.), the technical accounts of mindfulness in Indian Buddhist systematic thought (second century B.C.E. to fifth century C.E.), and some characteristic examples of different approaches to mindfulness in Buddhist meditation practice in China (seventh century), Tibet (10th to 15th centuries), and Burma (20th century), before concluding with some assessment of the tensions found in Buddhist notions of mindfulness and how these relate to modern scientific and therapeutic accounts of mindfulness.

However, here we report an advantage of being a nonnative speaker: Native speakers give foreign-accented speakers the benefit of the doubt when interpreting their utterances; as a result, apparently implausible utterances are more likely to be interpreted in a plausible way when delivered in a foreign than in a native accent. Across three replicated experiments, we demonstrated that native English speakers are more likely to interpret implausible utterances, such as “the mother gave the candle the daughter,” as similar plausible utterances (“the mother gave the candle to the daughter”) when the speaker has a foreign accent. This result follows from the general model of language interpretation in a noisy channel, under the hypothesis that listeners assume a higher error rate in foreign-accented than in nonaccented speech.},

L’une de ces pratiques a été le recrutement de nouveaux membres par des organisations terroristes comme Al Qaeda (Riedel, 2007). Al-Qaeda utilise des techniques d’influence sociale pour inciter les individus à devenir sympathisants des terroristes (Burton \& Stewart, 2008~; Gerwehr \& Daly, 2005~; Al-Saleh, 2007). En commençant par de simples demandes en ligne, puis en augmentant progressivement l’engagement à une cause, l’organisation terroriste peut influencer ses cibles afin qu’elles soutiennent des idéologies bien plus extrêmes qu’elles ne l’auraient fait. À l’image de ce que propose la théorie de l’auto-perception (Bem, 1972), les nouveaux convertis peuvent se forger des attitudes de plus en plus radicales consistantes avec leurs comportements qui se radicalisent. Le renforcement de la saillance de l’identité sociale d’appartenance à un groupe peut également amplifier l’influence de telles techniques de recrutement. Les implications pour la recherche sur l’influence sociale dans le recrutement en ligne des terroristes sont discutées.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

These are just some of the questions considered in an internationally acclaimed masterpiece by one of the world's greatest thinkers. It begins by reviewing the great theories of the cosmos from Newton to Einstein, before delving into the secrets which still lie at the heart of space and time, from the Big Bang to black holes, via spiral galaxies and strong theory. To this day A Brief History of Time remains a staple of the scientific canon, and its succinct and clear language continues to introduce millions to the universe and its wonders.},

  abstract = {The rhythm of human life is governed by diurnal cycles, as a result of endogenous circadian processes evolved to maximise biological fitness. Even complex aspects of daily life, such as affective states, exhibit systematic diurnal patterns which in turn influence behaviour. As a result, previous research has identified population-level diurnal patterns in affective preference for music. By analysing audio features from over two billion music streaming events, we find that the music people listen to can be divided into five distinct time blocks corresponding to morning, afternoon, evening, night and late night/early morning. By integrating an artificial neural network with Spotify’s API, we show a general awareness of diurnal preference in playlists, which is not present to the same extent for individual tracks. Our results demonstrate how music intertwines with our daily lives and highlight how evensomething as individual as musical preference is influenced by underlying diurnal patterns.},

The cultural intelligence hypothesis argues that this is mainly due to a species-specific set of social-cognitive skills, emerging early in ontogeny, for participating and exchanging knowledge in cultural groups. We tested this hypothesis by giving a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests to large numbers of two of humans' closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, as well as to 2.5-year-old human children before literacy and schooling. Supporting the cultural intelligence hypothesis and contradicting the hypothesis that humans simply have more “general intelligence,” we found that the children and chimpanzees had very similar cognitive skills for dealing with the physical world but that the children had more sophisticated cognitive skills than either of the ape species for dealing with the social world.},

While new methods such as mobile eye tracking and eye tracking in virtual/augmented realities are emerging quickly, the eye-movement terminology has scarcely been revised. We assert that this may cause confusion about two of the main concepts: fixations and saccades. In this study, we assessed the definitions of fixations and saccades held in the eye-movement field, by surveying 124 eye-movement researchers. These eye-movement researchers held a variety of definitions of fixations and saccades, of which the breadth seems even wider than what is reported in the literature. Moreover, these definitions did not seem to be related to researcher background or experience. We urge researchers to make their definitions more explicit by specifying all the relevant components of the eye movement under investigation: (i) the oculomotor component: e.g. whether the eye moves slow or fast; (ii) the functional component: what purposes does the eye movement (or lack thereof) serve; (iii) the coordinate system used: relative to what does the eye move; (iv) the computational definition: how is the event represented in the eye-tracker signal. This should enable eye-movement researchers from different fields to have a discussion without misunderstandings.},

  abstract = {Performance and success for many sociotechnical systems depend on the way the social and the technical parts interact and coevolve with each other. Such dynamic interactions are increasingly becoming an essential part of design and governance of many emerging systems such as sharing economy platforms and critical infrastructures. This paper makes a case for an agent-based approach to support the design and governance of sociotechnical systems and asserts that agent-based modeling (ABM) and simulation, with certain suggested revisions, can be a powerful methodology in this domain. This paper addresses three goals: The first is to make a case for using ABM in the analysis, design, and governance of sociotechnical systems due to systemic trends that increase the relevance of ABM. The second goal is to point to a crucial difference between the application of ABM to natural, social, and physical systems, where most of the ABM literature resides and its application to sociotechnical systems. As a part of this goal, we will focus on using ABM as a design tool to guide the behavior of sociotechnical systems at higher levels of abstraction by changing parameters at lower levels. The third goal is to provide a perspective on the often controversial topic of model validation for ABM and discuss various levels of expectations and flavors of validation for ABM. To this end, and building on the framework proposed under the second goal, we present a process that we call quasi-validation as a suggested high-level framework to gain confidence in using agent-based models for intervention-based scenario studies. Finally, we discuss a set of future research directions in ABM for design and governance of sociotechnical systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cognitive gadgets are distinctively human cognitive mechanisms – such as imitation, mind reading, and language – that have been shaped by cultural rather than genetic evolution. New gadgets emerge, not by genetic mutation, but by innovations in cognitive development; they are specialised cognitive mechanisms built by general cognitive mechanisms using information from the sociocultural environment. Innovations are passed on to subsequent generations, not by DNA replication, but through social learning: People with new cognitive mechanisms pass them on to others through social interaction. Some of the new mechanisms, like literacy, have spread through human populations, while others have died out, because the holders had more students, not just more babies. The cognitive gadgets hypothesis is developed through four case studies, drawing on evidence from comparative and developmental psychology, experimental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. The framework employed – cultural evolutionary psychology, a descendant of evolutionary psychology and cultural evolutionary theory – addresses parallel issues across the cognitive and behavioural sciences. In common with evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) and the extended evolutionary synthesis, cultural evolutionary psychology underlines the importance of developmental processes and environmental factors in the emergence of human cognition. In common with computational approaches (deep learning, predictive coding, hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal modelling), it emphasises the power of general-purpose mechanisms of learning. Cultural evolutionary psychology, however, also challenges use of the behavioural gambit in economics and behavioural ecology, and rejects the view that human minds are composed of “innate modules” or “cognitive instincts.”},

This article invokes uncertainty-identity theory to explore the role played by context-induced self-uncertainty in radicalization, violent extremism, and support for populist ideologies and autocratic leadership. Uncertainty-iden­ tity theory argues that people are motivated to reduce self and identity uncertainty, and that group identification satisfies this motivation. However, some groups and identities are more effective than others. Specifically, highly entitative groups with clearly defined prescriptive iden­ tities that are unambiguous and consensual – identities that echo populist ideology, conspiracy theories and victimhood narratives. Self-uncertainty creates a need for leadership, in particular leaders who are populist, auto­ cratic and toxic. I introduce uncertainty-identity theory to focus on its account of “extremism” – overviewing empirical support, and closing with discussion of warning signs of radicalization and speculations about pre­ ventative strategies.},

According to uncertainty-identity theory, this self-uncertainty can motivate people to identify with social groups, particularly groups that provide a distinctive and clearly defined identity and associated normative beliefs and behavioral prescriptions. This process can make more extreme groups and behaviors attractive as a source of identification-contingent uncertainty reduction. People may zealously identify with highly distinctive groups that have strong and directive leadership and ideological and ethnocentric belief systems that proscribe dissent and prescribe group-normative behavior. This analysis has been extended to help illuminate how extremism may emerge in the context of religion, politics, gangs, leadership, and adolescent risk taking.

However, these experiments have not provided user interface designers with an understanding of the severity or the nature of the difficulties young children have when using input devices. To address this need, we conducted a study to gain a better understanding of 4 and 5 year-old children's use of mice. We compared the performance of thirteen 4 year-olds, thirteen 5 year-olds and thirteen young adults in point-and-click tasks. Plots of the paths taken by the participants show severe differences between adults' and preschool children's ability to control the mouse. We were not surprised then to find age had a significant effect on accuracy, target reentry, and efficiency. We also found that target size had a significant effect on accuracy and target reentry. Measuring movement time at four different times (first entering target, last entering target, pressing button, releasing button) yielded the result that Fitts' law models children well only up to the time they first enter the target. Overall, we found that the difference between the performance of children and adults was large enough to warrant user interface interactions designed specifically for preschool children. The results additionally suggest that children need the most help once they get close to targets.},

  abstract = {Transfer learning is a classic paradigm by which models pretrained on large "upstream" datasets are adapted to yield good results on "downstream" specialized datasets. Generally, more accurate models on the "upstream" dataset tend to provide better transfer accuracy "downstream". In this work, we perform an in-depth investigation of this phenomenon in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the ImageNet dataset, which have been pruned - that is, compressed by sparsifying their connections. We consider transfer using unstructured pruned models obtained by applying several state-of-the-art pruning methods, including magnitude-based, second-order, re-growth, lottery-ticket, and regularization approaches, in the context of twelve standard transfer tasks. In a nutshell, our study shows that sparse models can match or even outperform the transfer performance of dense models, even at high sparsities, and, while doing so, can lead to significant inference and even training speedups. At the same time, we observe and analyze significant differences in the behaviour of different pruning methods.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a long-standing but underused method that allows researchers to simulate artificial worlds for hypothesis testing and theory building. Agent-based models (ABMs) offer unprecedented control and statistical power by allowing researchers to precisely specify the behavior of any number of agents and observe their interactions over time. ABMs are especially useful when investigating group behavior or evolutionary processes and can uniquely reveal nonlinear dynamics and emergence—the process whereby local interactions aggregate into often-surprising collective phenomena such as spatial segregation and relational homophily. We review several illustrative ABMs, describe the strengths and limitations of this method, and address two misconceptions about ABMs: reductionism and “you get out what you put in.” We also offer maxims for good and bad ABMs, give practical tips for beginner modelers, and include a list of resources and other models. We conclude with a seven-step guide to creating your own model.},

An overview is provided of the various empirical methods that are used for different kinds of questions. Four categories of empirical approaches are identified in which agent-based models have been empirically tested: case studies, stylized facts, role-playing games, and laboratory experiments. We discuss how these different types of empirical studies can be combined. The various ways empirical techniques are used illustrate the main challenges of contemporary social sciences: (1) how to develop models that are generalizable and still applicable in specific cases, and (2) how to scale up the processes of interactions of a few agents to interactions among many agents.},

It examines whether indirect minority influence can lead to social change as a function of cognitive rebalancing, a process whereby related attitudes are affected when one attitude is changed. An attitude updating algorithm was modelled with minimal assumptions drawing on social psychology theories of indirect minority influence. Results revealed that facing direct majority influence, indirect minority influence along with cognitive rebalancing is a recipe for social change. Furthermore, indirect minority influence promotes and maintains attitudinal diversity in local ingroups and throughout the society. We discuss the findings in terms of social influence theories and suggest promising avenues for model extensions for theory building in minority influence and social change.},

  abstract = {The author recounts some of the early history of what is now known as MBSR, and its relationship to mainstream medicine and the science of the mind/body connection and health. He stresses the importance that MBSR and other mindfulness-based interventions be grounded in a universal dharma understanding that is congruent with Buddhadharma but not constrained by its historical, cultural and religious manifestations associated with its counties of origin and their unique traditions. He locates these developments within an historic confluence of two very different epistemologies encountering each other for the first time, that of science and that of the meditative traditions. The author addresses the ethical ground of MBSR, as well as questions of lineage and of skillful ‘languaging’ and other means for maximizing the possibility that the value of cultivating mindfulness in the largest sense can be heard and embraced and cultivated in commonsensical and universal ways in secular settings. He directly addresses mindfulness-based instructors on the subject of embodying and drawing forth the essence of the dharma without depending on the vocabulary, texts, and teaching forms of traditional Buddhist environments, even though they are important to know to one degree or another as part of one’s own development. The author’s perspective is grounded in what the Zen tradition refers to as the one thousand year view. Although it is not stated explicitly in this text, he sees the current interest in mindfulness and its applications as signaling a multi-dimensional emergence of great transformative and liberative promise, one which, if cared for and tended, may give rise to a flourishing on this planet akin to a second, and this time global, Renaissance, for the benefit of all sentient beings and our world.},

The variables examined were prominent differences between studies undertaken by the co-authors that had vs. had not observed the effect. The resulting study found that the tendency to allocate more rewards to members of one's minimal group (vs. allocating equally to minimal in- and outgroup members) was stronger when participants were not socially isolated, when they received written (vs. verbal) instructions, and among Americans (vs. Australians). These results are consistent with certain theories of ingroup favoritism, and contradict others, particularly those that rely on some universal, context-independent psychological process (e.g., striving to enhance self-esteem following mere social categorization; evolved xenophobia). The study also illustrates the utility of adversarial collaborations, particularly when issues of replicability arise.},

  abstract = {Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008)BMJ337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and non-verbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people},

  abstract = {Optimizing convolutional neural networks for fast inference has recently become an extremely active area of research. One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.},

  abstract = {Metacognition is defined most simply as “thinking about thinking.” Metacognition consists of two components: knowledge and regulation. Metacognitive knowledge includes knowledge about oneself as a learner and the factors that might impact performance, knowledge about strategies, and knowledge about when and why to use strategies. Metacognitive regulation is the monitoring of one’s cognition and includes planning activities, awareness of comprehension and task performance, and evaluation of the efficacy of monitoring processes and strategies. Recent research suggests that young children are capable of rudimentary forms of metacognitive thought, particularly after the age of 3. Although individual developmental models vary, most postulate massive improvements in metacognition during the first 6 years of life. Metacognition also improves with appropriate instruction, with empirical evidence supporting the notion that students can be taught to reflect on their own thinking. Assessment of metacognition is challenging for a number of reasons: (a) metacognition is a complex construct; (b) it is not directly observable; (c) it may be confounded with both verbal ability and working memory capacity; and (d) existing measures tend to be narrow in focus and decontextualized from inschool learning. Recommendations for teaching and assessing metacognition are made.},

  abstract = {Cooperation is an emergent social state related to the dynamics and complexity of road traffic and is reinforced through adaptive learning. Game theory and research in behavioural economics provide ample evidence that cooperation can efficiently solve social dilemmas similar to traffic congestion in dynamic settings. Traffic theory, asserts User Equilibrium, is both a stable and equitable, albeit inefficient, network state, which is a behavioural outcome of the selfish uncoordinated decision of drivers. In contrast, the System Optimum is an efficient network state that minimizes the total travel costs but is hard to maintain due to the inherent cost inequalities drivers will incur. In this paper, we describe how the principles of game-theory in a simple 2-player game allow the emergence of a stable system optimum through cooperation. We then investigate what happens in n-player games by applying an agent-based route-choice model. The model shows how reinforced learning and different behavioural specifications regarding agents’ cognition – selfish or cooperative - brings a simple road network from User Equilibrium towards the system optimum while preserving sufficient equity amongst drivers. The results suggest that a sufficient number of route alternations between drivers and a certain degree of altruism allow for a selforganizing formation of a fairness equilibrium that can maintain the network in the system optimum. The implications of future congestion management strategies that can be implemented with information and communication technologies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Emotional progression in narratives is carefully structured by human authors to create unexpected and exciting situations, often culminating in a climactic moment. This paper explores how an autonomous computational designer can create frames of tension which guide the procedural creation of levels and their soundscapes in a digital horror game. Using narrative concepts, the autonomous designer can describe an intended experience that the automated level generator must adhere to. The level generator interprets this intent, bound by the possibilities and constraints of the game. The tension of the generated level guides the allocation of sounds in the level, using a crowdsourced model of tension.},

  abstract = {We present an agent-based model for studying the societal implications of attitude change theories. Various psychological theories of persuasive communication at the individual level are implemented as simulation experiments. The model allows us to investigate the effects of contagion and assimilation, motivated cognition, polarity, source credibility, and idiosyncratic attitude formation. Simulations show that different theories produce different characteristic macro-level patterns. Contagion and assimilation are central mechanisms for generating consensus, however, contagion generates a radicalised consensus. Motivated cognition causes societal polarisation or the fragmentation of attitudes. Polarity and source credibility have comparatively little effect on the societal distribution of attitudes. We discuss how the simulations provide a bridge between micro-level psychological theories and the aggregated macro-level studied by sociology. This approach enables new types of evidence for evaluating psychological theory to complement experimental approaches, thus answering calls to enhance the role of coherent and formalised theory in psychological science.},

  abstract = {There has been a great increase in literature concerned with the effects of a variety of mental training regimes that generally fall within what might be called contemplative practices, and a majority of these studies have focused on mindfulness. Mindfulness meditation practices can be conceptualized as a set of attention-based, regulatory, and self-inquiry training regimes cultivated for various ends, including wellbeing and psychological health. This article examines the construct of mindfulness in psychological research and reviews recent, nonclinical work in this area. Instead of proposing a single definition of mindfulness, we interpret it as a continuum of practices involving states and processes that can be mapped into a multidimensional phenomenological matrix which itself can be expressed in a neurocognitive framework. This phenomenological matrix of mindfulness is presented as a heuristic to guide formulation of next-generation research hypotheses from both cognitive/behavioral and neuroscientific perspectives. In relation to this framework, we review selected findings on mindfulness cultivated through practices in traditional and research settings, and we conclude by identifying significant gaps in the literature and outline new directions for research.},

  abstract = {Social psychologists have studied the psychological processes involved in persuasion, conformity, and other forms of social influence, but they have rarely modeled the ways influence processes play out when multiple sources and multiple targets of influence interact over time. However, workers in other fields from sociology and economics to cognitive science and physics have recognized the importance of social influence and have developed models of influence flow in populations and groups—generally without relying on detailed social psychological findings. This article reviews models of social influence from a number of fields, categorizing them using four conceptual dimensions to delineate the universe of possible models. The goal is to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations to build models that incorporate the detailed, microlevel understanding of influence processes derived from focused laboratory studies but contextualized in ways that recognize how multidirectional, dynamic influences are situated in people's social networks and relationships.},

  urldate = {2020-10-18},
  abstract = {The Danish Research Ethics Committee (REC) system was legally established in 1992, but its history goes back to the late 1970s. In 1977 an agreement was made between the Danish Medical Association, the Association of Danish Counties (representing the hospital owners), the Danish Medical Research Council, and others to establish a REC system in accordance with the Helsinki II declaration of the World Medical Association (1975). The system began working in 1980 and was fully established in 1982. The overwhelming majority of Danish hospitals are publicly owned, and most doctors are salaried employees of the public health service. From its inception the system therefore included the major players on the Danish health care scene. The legislation passed in 1992 merely formalised the features of the earlier system with a few changes, and made it absolutely clear that what is important in deciding whether a research project should be assessed is not the profession of the researcher, but the nature of the project. According to the law, all biomedical research projects must be submitted for approval, and the official commentary on the law makes it clear that 'biomedical' should be read very broadly to include all research projects involving present and former patients. The law was revised in 1996, and some uncomplicated questionnaire and register based studies are now exempt from the requirement of REC approval.3 Already from the beginning the Danish REC system was characterised by four main features which set it apart from most systems elsewhere:     RECs are regional and not institutional.     RECs are relatively small, and there is a large proportion of lay members.     There is a relatively easy mechanism for the approval of multi-centre trials.     There is a central national REC above the regional RECs. Denmark has eight regional RECs each covering one or more of the Danish counties. All biomedical research protocols within this geographic area must be submitted to the REC for approval. It is illegal and punishable by up to four months in prison to begin a biomedical research project without REC approval. A REC can make four different decisions about a project:     approval,     approval on the condition that certain changes are made (resubmission not necessary),     approval denied, but changes proposed for a possible resubmission, and     approval denied. Total denial of approval is rare, but it is very common that researchers are asked to change parts of their projects, most often the patient information sheet. All decisions about approval of a research project must be unanimous in the regional committees, otherwise the project is referred to the Central Research Ethics Committee (CREC). A researcher who is not satisfied with the decision of the regional REC can appeal to the CREC. Decisions made by the CREC are final and cannot be appealed to any other administrative body. A committee has between 7 and 15 members, with a majority of lay members of one (i.e., if there are 7 members, 4 are lay and 3 are professional). The professional members are appointed by the Danish Health Sciences Research Council, and the lay members are appointed by the County Councils. Although the lay members are politically appointed, they do not represent their respective political parties in the REC. The lay members are not usually lawyers, clergy or philosophers, but 'true' lay people. The members are appointed for four year periods, and can be reappointed once. Each REC has a secretariat, usually staffed by a lawyer, but there are no bioethics advisors attached to the RECs. One problem in the system is that few RECs have access to expertise within research methodology, and therefore they may have problems in assessing certain kinds of projects (e.g., projects involving very advanced statistical methods or qualitative research methods). The number of research projects assessed by each REC varies between 120 and 500 per year, with the RECs covering university hospitals having the largest work load. Some RECs debate all submitted projects in a meeting of the full REC, whereas others only debate those projects that at least one member finds problematic. The reason for having regionally and not institutionally based RECs is that this removes some of the pressures that an institutionally based REC may encounter. In an institution there may be pressure applied on the REC to approve or disapprove certain kinds of research, disregarding the ethical status of the research. A regional REC is far less likely to succumb to such pressures because the members are not all associated with one single institution. The RECs have a legal right to control whether research projects are conducted in accordance with the permission given, and to have access to the final results of a trial. This right is very seldom used at present, because the RECs lack the manpower to perform active controls. Prior to the last revision of the legislation in 1996 the RECs and a number of commentators in the public debate advocated more funding for the RECs in order to enable them to take on an active controlling role, but this proposal did not find favour with the politicians.},

  abstract = {Water governance remains a challenge for human societies, especially when the variation in resource inflow is large and the resource users are heterogeneous. We analyze with a coupled social-ecological systems (SES) model how socioeconomic and environmental changes affect the resilience of social norms governing resource use. In our model, agents have access to water as a common-pool resource and allocate it between rainy and dry seasons. While it is socially optimal to save water for the dry season, it is individually optimal to take water immediately. In our model, punishment of norm violators is the mechanism that may sustain cooperation. We show that the resilience of social norms could be affected by changes in socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Particularly, we find that social norms may collapse in times of resource scarcity and variability, especially if several drivers act in concert. Finally, we find that user heterogeneity in the form of different skills and inequality in land endowments may undermine cooperation. This implies that climatic changes and increased inequality – both potential drivers in the field – may affect community resilience and may lead to an erosion of social norms.},

  abstract = {In linguistic theories of how sentences encode meaning, a distinction is often made between the context-free rule-based combination of lexical-semantic features of the words within a sentence (“semantics”), and the contributions made by wider context (“pragmatics”). In psycholinguistics, this distinction has led to the view that listeners initially compute a local, context-independent meaning of a phrase or sentence before relating it to the wider context. An important aspect of such a two-step perspective on interpretation is that local semantics cannot initially be overruled by global contextual factors. In two spoken-language event-related potential experiments, we tested the viability of this claim by examining whether discourse context can overrule the impact of the core lexical-semantic feature animacy, considered to be an innate organizing principle of cognition. Two-step models of interpretation predict that verb-object animacy violations, as in “The girl comforted the clock,” will always perturb the unfolding interpretation process, regardless of wider context. When presented in isolation, such anomalies indeed elicit a clear N400 effect, a sign of interpretive problems. However, when the anomalies were embedded in a supportive context (e.g., a girl talking to a clock about his depression), this N400 effect disappeared completely. Moreover, given a suitable discourse context (e.g., a story about an amorous peanut), animacy-violating predicates (“the peanut was in love”) were actually processed more easily than canonical predicates (“the peanut was salted”). Our findings reveal that discourse context can immediately overrule local lexical-semantic violations, and therefore suggest that language comprehension does not involve an initially context-free semantic analysis.},

  abstract = {Objective Social media is becoming increasingly popular as a platform for sharing personal health-related information. This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and user-expressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media.Methods We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words’ semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique.Results ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction performance.Conclusion It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, user-generated content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated training data sets.},

We delineate Adversarial Genetic Programming for Cyber Security, a research topic that, by means of genetic programming (GP), replicates and studies the behavior of cyber adversaries and the dynamics of their engagements. Adversarial Genetic Programming for Cyber Security encompasses extant and immediate research efforts in a vital problem domain, arguably occupying a position at the frontier where GP matters. Additionally, it prompts research questions around evolving complex behavior by expressing different abstractions with GP and opportunities to reconnect to the machine learning, artificial life, agent-based modeling and cyber security communities. We present a framework called RIVALS which supports the study of network security arms races. Its goal is to elucidate the dynamics of cyber networks under attack by computationally modeling and simulating them.},

Such phenomena constitute a universal trait of multisensory perception even in non-human species, and seem to result, at least in part, from the adaptation of sensory systems to natural scene statistics. Despite recent developments in the study of crossmodal correspondences, there are still a number of standing questions about their definition, their origins, their plasticity, and their underlying computational mechanisms. In this paper, I will review such questions in the light of current research on sensory cue integration, where crossmodal correspondences can be conceptualized in terms of natural mappings across different sensory cues that are present in the environment and learnt by the sensory systems. Finally, I will provide some practical guidelines for the design of experiments that might shed new light on crossmodal correspondences.},

  abstract = {As a follow-up on our previous study of a series of purines (purine, 6-chloropurine, purine-6-thiol, hypoxanthine, theobromine, theophylline, caffeine, and uric acid), we have investigated six additional biologically important purines (adenine, guanine, isoguanine, thioguanine, xanthine, and kinetin). Their ground-state dipole moments were measured in dioxane at 293 K. The first excited singlet-state dipole moments were obtained using the solvatochromic shift equations (McRae, Suppan, Bakhshiev, and Kawski-Chamma-Viallet). The theoretical dipole moments were calculated as a combination of the π-moment (PPP method) and the σ-moment (vector sum of the σ-bond and σ-group moments). The same approach was used to obtain their first excited singlet-state dipole moments (excited state π-moment; σ-moment assumed to be the same as in the ground state).               Ab initio               HF 6-31G               **               calculations were also used to obtain ground-state dipole moments for all the fourteen purines under study. In addition, a DFT/B3PW91/6311++(2df,2p) calculation has been carried out for purine for comparison. The different sets of theoretical dipole moments were compared with the respective experimental values. There is an approximately equally good agreement among the experimental dipole moments and the PPP + σ dipole moments (±6.9\%) and the               ab initio               dipole moments (±7.4\%). The effect of structure on the dipole moments is discussed.},

  abstract = {Scientists studying how languages change over time often make an analogy between biological and cultural evolution, with words or grammars behaving like traits subject to natural selection. Recent work has exploited this analogy by using models of biological evolution to explain the properties of languages and other cultural artefacts. However, the mechanisms of biological and cultural evolution are very different: biological traits are passed between generations by genes, while languages and concepts are transmitted through learning. Here we show that these different mechanisms can have the same results, demonstrating that the transmission of frequency distributions over variants of linguistic forms by Bayesian learners is equivalent to the Wright–Fisher model of genetic drift. This simple learning mechanism thus provides a justification for the use of models of genetic drift in studying language evolution. In addition to providing an explicit connection between biological and cultural evolution, this allows us to define a ‘neutral’ model that indicates how languages can change in the absence of selection at the level of linguistic variants. We demonstrate that this neutral model can account for three phenomena: the s-shaped curve of language change, the distribution of word frequencies, and the relationship between word frequencies and extinction rates.},

  abstract = {Eyes move over visual scenes to gather visual information. Studies have found heavy-tailed distributions in measures of eye movements during visual search, which raises questions about whether these distributions are pervasive to eye movements, and whether they arise from intrinsic or extrinsic factors. Three different measures of eye movement trajectories were examined during visual foraging of complex images, and all three were found to exhibit heavy tails: Spatial clustering of eye movements followed a power law distribution, saccade length distributions were lognormally distributed, and the speeds of slow, small amplitude movements occurring during fixations followed a 1/f spectral power law relation. Images were varied to test whether the spatial clustering of visual scene information is responsible for heavy tails in eye movements. Spatial clustering of eye movements and saccade length distributions were found to vary with image type and task demands, but no such effects were found for eye movement speeds during fixations. Results showed that heavy-tailed distributions are general and intrinsic to visual foraging, but some of them become aligned with visual stimuli when required by task demands. The potentially adaptive value of heavy-tailed distributions in visual foraging is discussed.},

  abstract = {The science of mental life and behavior has paid scant attention to the means by which mental life is translated into physical behavior. Why this is so was the topic of a 2005 American Psychologist article whose main title was “The Cinderella of Psychology.” In the present article, we briefly review some of the reasons why motor control was relegated to the sidelines of psychology. Then we point to work showing that experimental psychologists have much to contribute to research on action generation. We focus on studies showing that actions are generated in a way that, at least by default, minimize changes between successive actions. The method is computationally as well as physically economical but also requires consideration of costs, including costs of different kinds. How such costs are compared is discussed in the next section. The final section offers comments about the future of psychologically focused action research. Two additional themes of the review concern methods for studying action generation. First, much can be learned through naturalistic observation. Second, subsequent experiments, designed to check naturalistic observations, can use very simple equipment and procedures. This can make the study of action generation easy to pursue in the psychology laboratory.},

A systematic literature review identified 20 studies between 1970 and 2014 focusing on the role of contingent and noncontingent background music to facilitate task engagement, enhance performance, and alter behavior. Though the research addressing background music has mixed results, there is evidence suggesting that this could be an effective strategy for increasing task engagement and performance and decreasing stimulatory behavior for individuals with developmental disabilities. Since music can be considered inexpensive and may be less intrusive in comparison to other strategies, its use merits additional study to explore how and to what extent music affects behavior.},

As Americans, we assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction--but choice overload can make you question your decisions before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for failures. This can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and stress. In this book, social scientist Schwartz explains at what point choice--the hallmark of individual freedom that we so cherish--becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. He offers practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.--From publisher description.},

This study investigated whether individuals form a representation of a coactor’s task when the context does not require interpersonal coordination. Pairs of participants performed a reaction time (RT) task alongside each other, responding to 2 different dimensions of the same stimulus. Results showed that each actor’s performance was influenced by the other’s task. RTs on trials that required a response from both participants were slowed compared with trials that required only a response from 1 actor. Similar results were observed when each participant knew the other’s task but could not observe the other’s actions. These findings provide evidence that shared task representations are formed in social settings that do not require interpersonal coordination and emerge as a consequence of how a social situation is conceptualized.},

  abstract = {Flow, "the optimal experience," is a state of pleasant deep-focus on the task at hand that is both challenging and rewarding. Naturally, flow is a hot topic in videogame research. The purpose of this study is to determine what impact a generative music system embedded in a videogame would have on the subjective experience of flow. In this study, participants played two versions of a Tetris-like game. One version had a generative music system for the music soundtrack, and the other had a traditional interactive soundtrack. Participants that played the version with the generative music system first reported flow more than those that played the traditional soundtrack version first. Participants were not made aware of the manipulation, nor were they capable of correctly identifying any differences between the two versions when asked. Another purpose of this study was to begin to bring together disparate bodies of literature: musicology, experimental psychology and music theory. These fields have much to offer each other, but are not often enough connected. Keywords: flow, generative music, GameFlow, algorithmic music, game design, music},

Recently, it has become possible to link these theories within a common framework. This framework assumes that perception is implicit neural inference, combining sensory evidence with prior perceptual knowledge. Within this framework, perceptual differences may occur because of enhanced precision in how sensory evidence is represented or because sensory evidence is weighted much higher than prior perceptual knowledge. In this preliminary study, we compared these models using groups with high and low autistic trait scores (Autism-Spectrum Quotient). We found evidence supporting the cognitive bias model and no evidence for the enhanced sensory precision model.},

Schelling’s (1971) agents seek to avoid being in a local minority, and Kalick and Hamilton’s (1986) agents seek attractive partners; they independently pursue those individual goals based on their own local information. There is no central authority, controller, or planner—for example, nobody explicitly assigns attractive individuals to pair up with other attractive ones. This property means that populationscale patterns or structures that emerge from a multiagent system are because of processes of self-organization rather than centralized design and planning (Kauffman, 1995; Resnick, 1994).},

However, it remains unclear how the interplay between the two shapes the way individuals monitor opinion climates, which play a critical role in public opinion dynamics. Using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach, this study aims to explore the conditions under which social networks and mass media interact to facilitate or hinder the emergence of large-scale spirals of silence. The simulation results show that the spiral of silence in a networked environment may be locally observable, but not likely on a global scale?unless the opinion representation of mass media becomes extremely homogeneous, individuals are hyperconnected, or both, the majority-minority opinion gap found locally seldom escalates to the global silence of the minority.},

  abstract = {Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g., the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the modal response. In a series of experiments involving most of the classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.},

We should explore these new models of reciprocal altruism because they predict different stability characteristics for various strategies; for instance, I show that strategies such as Tit-for-Tat have different stability dynamics in these alternate models.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Extreme natural events, like e.g. tsunamis or earthquakes, regularly lead to catastrophes with dramatic consequences. In recent years natural disasters caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, destruction of infrastructure, disruption of economic activity and loss of billions of dollars worth of property and thus revealed considerable deficits hindering their effective management: Needs for stakeholders, decision-makers as well as for persons concerned include systematic risk identification and evaluation, a way to assess countermeasures, awareness raising and decision support systems to be employed before, during and after crisis situations. The overall goal of this study focuses on interdisciplinary integration of various scientific disciplines to contribute to a tsunami early warning information system. In comparison to most studies our focus is on high-end geometric and thematic analysis to meet the requirements of small-scale, heterogeneous and complex coastal urban systems. Data, methods and results from engineering, remote sensing and social sciences are interlinked and provide comprehensive information for disaster risk assessment, management and reduction. In detail, we combine inundation modeling, urban morphology analysis, population assessment, socio-economic analysis of the population and evacuation modeling. The interdisciplinary results eventually lead to recommendations for mitigation strategies in the fields of spatial planning or coping capacity.},

  abstract = {Human cognition has usually been approached on the level of individual minds and brains, but social interaction is a challenging case. Is it best thought of as a self-contained individual cognitive process aiming at an “understanding of the other,” or should it rather be approached as an collective, inter-personal process where individual cognitive components interact on a moment-to-moment basis to form coupled dynamics? In a combined fMRI and eye-tracking study we directly contrasted these models of social cognition. We found that the perception of situations affording social contingent responsiveness (e.g., someone offering or showing you an object) elicited activations in regions of the right posterior temporal sulcus and yielded greater pupil dilation corresponding to a model of coupled dynamics (joint action). In contrast, the social-cognitive perception of someone “privately” manipulating an object elicited activation in medial prefrontal cortex, the right inferior frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal lobus, regions normally associated with Theory of Mind and with the mirror neuron system. Our findings support a distinction in social cognition between social observation and social interaction, and demonstrate that simple ostensive cues may shift participants' experience, behavior, and brain activity between these modes. The identification of a distinct, interactive mode has implications for research on social cognition, both in everyday life and in clinical conditions.},

  abstract = {Writing Philosophy: A Student's Guide to Writing Philosophy Essays is a concise, self-guided manual that covers the basics of argumentative essay writing and encourages students to master fundamental skills quickly, with minimal instructor input. Opening with an introductory chapter on how to read philosophy, the book then moves into the basics of writing summaries and analyzing arguments. It provides step-by-step instructions for each phase of the writing process, from formulating a thesis, to creating an outline, to writing a final draft, supplementing this tutorial approach with model essays, outlines, introductions, and conclusions. Skills essential to evaluating arguments, citing sources, avoiding plagiarism, detecting fallacies, and formatting final drafts are dealt with in detail. The final two chapters serve as a reference guide to common mistakes and basic skills in sentence construction, writing style, and word choice. Employing a rulebook format similar to that of the classic Elements of Style (by Strunk, White, and Angell), Lewis Vaughn distills helpful writing advice into simple rules that students can easily remember and apply--and that instructors can refer to when reviewing student papers. These rules cover essay organization, sentence structure, documentation styles, plagiarism, grammar, usage, and more. Written in a clear and engaging style and incorporating samples of student writing, Writing Philosophy is an indispensable resource for virtually any philosophy course.},

When applying such guidelines to examine existing practices, assessment studies are limited by the artifacts released by modelers. Although code is the final product defining an artificial society, 90\% of the code produced is not released hence previous assessments necessarily focused on higher-level items such as conceptual design or validation. We address this gap by collecting 338 artificial societies from two hosting platforms, CoMSES/OpenABM and GitHub. An innovation of our approach is the use of software engineering techniques to automatically examine the models with respect to items such as commenting the code, using libraries, or dividing code into functions. We found that developers of artificial societies code the decision-making of their agents from scratch in every model, despite the existence of several libraries that could be used as building blocks.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful paradigm to gain insight into social phenomena. One area that ABM has rarely been applied is coalition formation. Traditionally, coalition formation is modelled using cooperative game theory. In this paper, a heuristic algorithm is developed that can be embedded into an ABM to allow the agents to find coalition. The resultant coalition structures are comparable to those found by cooperative game theory solution approaches, specifically, the core. A heuristic approach is required due to the computational complexity of finding a cooperative game theory solution which limits its application to about only a score of agents. The ABM paradigm provides a platform in which simple rules and interactions between agents can produce a macro-level effect without the large computational requirements. As such, it can be an effective means for approximating cooperative game solutions for large numbers of agents. Our heuristic algorithm combines agent-based modeling and cooperative game theory to help find agent partitions that are members of a games’ core solution. The accuracy of our heuristic algorithm can be determined by comparing its outcomes to the actual core solutions. This comparison achieved by developing an experiment that uses a specific example of a cooperative game called the glove game. The glove game is a type of exchange economy game. Finding the traditional cooperative game theory solutions is computationally intensive for large numbers of players because each possible partition must be compared to each possible coalition to determine the core set; hence our experiment only considers games of up to nine players. The results indicate that our heuristic approach achieves a core solution over 90\% of the time for the games considered in our experiment.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modelling (ABM) and social network analysis (SNA) are both valuable tools for exploring the impact of human interactions on a broad range of social and ecological patterns. Integrating these approaches offers unique opportunities to gain insights into human behaviour that neither the evaluation of social networks nor agent-based models alone can provide. There are many intriguing examples that demonstrate this potential, for instance in epidemiology, marketing or social dynamics. Based on an extensive literature review, we provide an overview on coupling ABM with SNA and evaluating the integrated approach. Building on this, we identify current shortcomings in the combination of the two methods. The greatest room for improvement is found with regard to (i) the consideration of the concept of social integration through networks, (ii) an increased use of the co-evolutionary character of social networks and embedded agents, and (iii) a systematic and quantitative model analysis focusing on the causal relationship between the agents and the network. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of a comprehensive and clearly structured model conceptualization and documentation. We synthesize our findings in guidelines that contain the main aspects to consider when integrating social networks into agent-based models.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the use of sonification (the transformation of non-musical data into sound) as a means of creating generative music (algorithmic music which is evolving in real time and is of potentially infinite length). It consists of a portfolio of ten works where the possibilities of sonification as a strategy for creating generative works is examined. As well as exploring the viability of sonification as a compositional strategy toward infinite work, each work in the portfolio aims to explore the notion of how artistic coherency between data and resulting sound is achieved ? rejecting the notion that sonification for artistic means leads to the arbitrary linking of data and sound. In the accompanying written commentary the definitions of sonification and generative music are considered, as both are somewhat contested terms requiring operationalisation to correctly contextualise my own work. Having arrived at these definitions each work in the portfolio is documented. For each work, the genesis of the work is considered, the technical composition and operation of the piece (a series of tutorial videos showing each work in operation supplements this section) and finally its position in the portfolio as a whole and relation to the research question is evaluated. The body of work is considered as a whole in relation to the notion of artistic coherency. This is separated into two main themes: the relationship between the underlying nature of the data and the compositional scheme and the coherency between the data and the soundworld generated by each piece.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of MP3 players and the exploding amount of digital music content call for novel ways of music organization and retrieval to meet the ever-increasing demand for easy and effective information access. As almost every music piece is created to convey emotion, music organization and retrieval by emotion is a reasonable way of accessing music information. A good deal of effort has been made in the music information retrieval community to train a machine to automatically recognize the emotion of a music signal. A central issue of machine recognition of music emotion is the conceptualization of emotion and the associated emotion taxonomy. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of different ways of emotion annotation, model training, and result visualization. This article provides a comprehensive review of the methods that have been proposed for music emotion recognition. Moreover, as music emotion recognition is still in its infancy, there are many open issues. We review the solutions that have been proposed to address these issues and conclude with suggestions for further research.},
